        <p class=" ">The purpose of text categorization [1] is to classify text documents into different pre-
          defined classes. There is little published research into the classification of formal and
          informal (English) text. A systematic study on text formality classification is missing
          from the literature so far. The most relevant work about formal and informal text classification is done by
          Fadi Abu Sheikha and Diana Inkpen [2]. They classify formal and
          informal documents based on the features extracted from the data sets. Some short-
          comings of their research are discussed in the following paragraph. Based on analysis
          and our critical review of this research, we extend the binary classification model from
          the fore-mentioned research to a multi-class classification model. Instead of predicting
          a document as either formal or informal, we also work on a model that can predict
          the formality of a document on a scale from one to three, with degree one being very
          informal, two being semi-formal/informal, and degree three as very formal. In the end,
          we discuss which key factors contribute to the formality or informality of a text and
          provide some ideas or solutions to change the text style. Our objective is to achieve a
          sustainable and replicable model with a high accuracy with the flexibility to extend it
          for the future research.</p>
        <p>
          The prior research [2] do not disclose the exact algorithm they used, and they extract
          the feature using Connexor parser [3] which is not convenient to use locally. The data
          sets used in the research are not optimal and inconsistent. For example, in the Enron
          email dataset, even though emails are usually informal in the setting of normal life, many
          emails in the Enron data sets are quite formal, as expected from a former huge company. Some of the data sets
          they used include annotations that are difficult to cleanse
          manually. The rest of the data sets are adequate for the classification, and we also use
          some of them in our heterogeneous dataset. </p>
        <p> This research improves on the prior study and provide an implementation of the text
          classification models to assist Yoast for their future development in that field. Yoast [4]
          provides a SEO (search engine optimization) plugin for Wordpress and other other simi-
          lar platforms, which has been used across millions of websites. The function of the SEO
          plugin is to help users achieve a high position in search engine results. This includes offering feedback and
          suggestions for improvements to the content of their websites. In this
          paper, we focus on the formality side of writing since the styles of writing can influence
          the readers’ attitude towards the content. For example, when reading a fun story, one
          would expect the creator to make use of abbreviation, slang, colloquial language,etc.. On
          the other hand, in a newspaper, readers like to see more formal and serious text to build
          trust in the content of the newspaper. Since text formality and informality contribute
          greatly to the content of its users, Yoast would like to make the informal and formal
          classification a tool to assist the process of content creation. This thesis starts with
          a replication of the text formality classification method from the research [2] done by
          Fadi Abu Sheikha and Diana Inkpen. Afterwards, we extend the research to multi-class
          classification on heterogeneous datasets. The concept of the models is well structured
          to allow for modifications and follow-up research in the future.
        </p>
        <p> Following [2], we extract features from each document and quantify the features as numerals. After the
          desired features for each documents are extracted, we train and verify
          the model with stratified k-fold cross validation. Afterwards, we examine the features
          to see which (subset of) features are essential when distinguishing formal and informal
          texts with a recursive feature selection method.</p>
        <p>
          In the discussion section we compare several kinds of classifiers (Decision tree classifier,
          logistic regression classifier and random forest) in the experiment, analyze and discuss
          the classifiers based on two different datasets, and implement the mock-up classification
          algorithms. The choices made for the classifiers are limited by the JavaScript implementation. For decision
          tree model, we only need to distinguish different documents
          according to the feature splitting suggested by the decision tree model. In other words,
          the decision tree result could be utilized to create a rule-based algorithm. For logistic
          regression, we could apply the weight and bias to the features and get an approximate
          result to determine the type of document. In the end, we also discuss what makes
          documents formal and informal and how to interchange them.</p>
